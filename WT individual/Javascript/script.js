// variables in javascript can be declared using the following 2 functions 
        // 1. let [for declaring blocked-scope varibales]
              (Mutable/Changing)
        // 2. const for declaring constant variable
              (fixed)
// values can be updated if its defined with "let" keyword
// but if you know a varibale will be constant throught the code then decalre it const whcih cant be changed 

// VARIABLE NAMES CANT BE STARTED WITH NUMBERS
// VARIABLE NAMES SHOULD START WITH EITHER underscore_,dollar sign $, or letter
// Javascript is case sensitive
// Keywords can't be used as variable names

//Decalration and Initialisation
let a = 10  
let b = 20  

const name = "Utkarsh" // const variables should be initialised as declared because they cant be changed later

console.log("a+b :",a+b)
